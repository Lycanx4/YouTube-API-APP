This video assumes NO prior experience with Android, and by the end you'll have something an app you could publish. We'll cover how to create the user interface with XML, and how to code the logic using the Kotlin programming language. These are the fundamental building blocks of any modern Android app. 

We'll use the ConstraintLayout for the layout and two event listeners for the app logic. After you enter a base amount and a tip percentage, the app will calculate the tip and total for you. We also implement a tip percentage animation and a footer to make our app more unique.

In particular, this MOOC covers key Java programming language features that control the flow of execution through an app (such as Java‚Äôs various looping constructs and conditional statements), enable access to structured data (such as Java's built-in arrays and common classes in the Java Collections Framework, such as ArrayList and HashMap), group related operations and data into classes and interfaces (such as Java's primitive and user-defined types, fields, methods, generic parameters, and exceptions), customize the behavior of existing classes via inheritance and polymorphism (such as subclassing and overriding virtual methods). Learners will apply these Java features in the context of core Android components (such as Activities and basic UI elements) by applying common tools (such as Android Studio) needed to develop Java programs and useful Android apps.

What Is Kotlin?
Kotlin is one of the fastest-growing and widely used programming languages. In May 2017 google announced it as an official language for developing android applications. After this announcement, the jobs for kotlin increased in large numbers, since then the job opening for kotlin gets doubled every three months as per Dice. It is a very easy and friendly language also it is quite easy to maintain and debug this language which is why it is a good language to start with.

Kotlin is an open-source, statically typed language designed by Jet brains. It has both the features of object-oriented programming and functional programming. Kotlin is interoperable with java which means both languages can share and use the information and just like the java compiler, the kotlin compiler also generates the byte code which can run on JVM.  Also, we can say Kotlin is a kind of java with some added features, even the java libraries can also be used in Kotlin project. Although java is a really cool language, the developers of kotlin focused more on simplifying the code and increasing the transparency.

Kotlin language can be used on multiple platforms which reduces the time that is spent on writing and maintaining the code on different platforms. Kotlin doesn‚Äôt depend on a virtual machine on the target platform.

In Kotlin, there is a data class. A data class is a class that doesn't perform any operation and only contains a state. The advantage of this class is that it provides self-generated code and avoids the implementation of methods within the class. 

Kotlin is used in data science as well, because of its features like null safety, statically typed, maintainable code, and also being a language that runs on Jvm makes kotlin a good choice for working with the data. Companies such as Google, Uber, Netflix, and Airbnb use Kotlin for their daily business operations. Flutter is an open-source mobile SDK developer that can use to build native-looking Android and iOS applications from the same code base.

00:00 - Introduction
00:59 - What are Data tables
01:29 - What is database schema ?
01:51 - What are rows and column ?
02:11 - What is primary Key ?
02:56 - what is SQLite ?
03:18  - What is Structured Query Language (SQL) ?
03:44 - Practical Demo App



Hello guys welcome back in this video we are going to learn about Database handling in Android application. We will use SQLIte database for a practical demo application.
So stay tuned and watch the video till the end.


Almost every android application needs permananat data storage place for storing some kind of user data. Sqlite is light weight and compact database specifically designed to store 
mobile apps data. This video is divided into two parts. In the first part we will cover some theoratical concepts about SQLite database management.
Whereas in second part we will develop a practical demo application to see Android OS and SQLite database management in action.

What are Data tables ?
Database table is the basic structure in any kind of database. These are used to store only specific kind of data.
For example user table will contain the user name, email, first name , last name and password etc.
Whereas products table will contain data including product name, price, expiry date, brand etc.


What is database scheme ?
schema is the check and balance on the limit and type of data. For example we can restrict customer name to 20 characters only or his phone number can have only numerical values and 
an email must have email with @mailname.com etc.

What are rows and column ?
you must have seen excel sheet or any spread sheet where data is stored in rows and column. Same applies on database table having multiple rows and columns.
In columns we can see the data of different customers, whereas rows have data specific to a particular customer.


What is primary Key ?
So almost each database table must have one or more columns having  unique data in them. It is used to recognize that particular row or record. 
It also shows us that particular row or record belongs to that specif unique data entry.
for example in user column , user mobile or national ID card no or passport no must be unique and different to any other entry or record in database.
So this unique database entry column may serve us as a primary key. and without primary key, it will be nearly impossible to manage and get data from specific row in database.

what is SQLite ?
SQLite is a compact and light weight database and does not require any kind of server to run it. It is easily integrated with any kind of mobile application.
There are libraries and classes available in android to perform any kind of database query on SQLite.


What is Structured Query Language (SQL) ?

It is high level lanaguage, which is developed to perform any kind of query on database.
Suppose if you want to insert any kind of data in any database ROW. It provides very simple and easy Insert command syntaxt to perform that specific task


so , now we have all theoretical knowledge, now let us create our demo application.

Now push notification has two sides.

1. Formatting message & sending from server end. Now in our case the server end is firebase i.e Firebase Cloud Messaging.
2. Receiving message and displaying it using different notification styles on client side.

Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)

In this part of the course you are going to learn about following topics

Sending messages to all users from FCM dashboard
Sending messages to topic based users from FCM dashboard
Configuring request data for FCM rest api
Sending messages to individual users using FCM rest api
Sending messages to topic based users using FCM rest api
Sending messages to group of users using FCM rest api

This part of course is useful for indie developers to send notifications to specific users. Also it is useful for back end developers to configure push notification in their project.

Android Notification Styles

You might have seen applications sending notifications with different styles to engage their users or to make them take action. In this part of the course you will learn different styles of displaying notification.

1. BigText Notification
2. BigPicture Notification
3. Notification Actions
4. Direct reply Notification
5. Inbox Style Notification
6. Message Style¬†Notification

You can use these different styles as per your requirement.

Java is among the most popular programming languages out there, mainly because of how versatile and compatible it is. Java can be used for a large number of things, including software development, mobile applications, and large systems development. As of 2019, 88% market share of all smartphones run on Android, the mobile operating system written in Java. Knowing Java opens a great deal of doors for you as a developer.

This course provides an introduction to the Java language and object-oriented programming, including an overview of Java syntax.

In this video we are going to develop a simple Stopwatch application in Android Studio, using Kotlin and Jetpack Compose. This project requires only one library/dependency and that is a Dagger-Hilt library. In this video I'm going to teach you how to combine foreground with bound service but also how to use notifications as well. Be sure to watch the hole video, since there are lots of important things I'm going to share with you all. Enjoy! :)
