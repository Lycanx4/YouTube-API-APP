So, what is C#?
C# (pronounced ""See Sharp"") is a modern, object-oriented, and type-safe programming language. C# enables developers to build many types of secure and robust applications that run in .NET. C# has its roots in the C family of languages and will be immediately familiar to C, C++, Java, and JavaScript programmers. This tour provides an overview of the major components of the language in C# 8 and earlier. If you want to explore the language through interactive examples, try the introduction to C# tutorials.

C# is an object-oriented, component-oriented programming language. C# provides language constructs to directly support these concepts, making C# a natural language in which to create and use software components. Since its origin, C# has added features to support new workloads and emerging software design practices. At its core, C# is an object-oriented language. You define types and their behavior.

C# programs run on .NET, a virtual execution system called the common language runtime (CLR) and a set of class libraries. The CLR is the implementation by Microsoft of the common language infrastructure (CLI), an international standard. The CLI is the basis for creating execution and development environments in which languages and libraries work together seamlessly.

A type defines the structure and behavior of any data in C#. The declaration of a type may include its members, base type, interfaces it implements, and operations permitted for that type. A variable is a label that refers to an instance of a specific type.

To learn more, make sure to watch the video, and we promise you that you'll become a C# developer by the end of the course! Have fun!

Probably DRY, SOLID, Logging, Dependency Injection, Localization, Separation of Concerns, and Unit Testing at the very least. These seem like obvious things that every application should have. In this video, we are going to do something a bit unique. I am going to show you how to do all of those things, and I am going to show you why you shouldn't always do those things. We are going to build the ultimate Hello World application. You won't want to miss it.

What is C# programming language?
C# (C Sharp) is a multi-paradigm, general-purpose programming language. C# programming language encompasses the programming disciplines of static typing, strong typing, lexically scoped, imperative, declarative, functional, generic, object-oriented (class-based), and component-oriented.

What is C# application?
C# is a popular programming language for creating desktop applications, web applications, and web services. It is widely used in the development of Microsoft applications on a large scale. C# is also used in Unity game development.
Net framework is a ground-breaking platform that allows you to create the following types of applications:
Applications for Windows
Web-based applications
Web-based services
Net framework applications are cross-platform in nature. 

✅What is C# Programming? 
C# is a modern, object-oriented, general-purpose programming language that is pronounced ""C sharp."" It was created inside the.Net project by Microsoft, led by Anders Hejlsberg and his team, and was authorised by the European Computer Manufacturers Association (ECMA) and the International Standards Organization (ISO). C# is one of the languages supported by the Common Language Infrastructure, and the current version is 7.2. C# is syntactically similar to Java and is simple for users who are familiar with C, C++, or Java.

✅C# Career Prospects:
With just C# programming expertise, you will have excellent job opportunities, salaries, and career prospects. However, for a career based on programming languages such as Java and Python (which are in more demand than C#) or for careers based on front-end, back-end, and full-stack development, you will go a lot further with C# expertise. Furthermore, in development domains such as software testing, you are expected to know C#. C# gives us more Edge over other languages because of its .Net Framework integration.

Static virtual members in interfaces will allow for much better generic abstraction over math, as well as more direct expression of abstract factories, strategies, etc.

We’re also adding list patterns to pattern matching, a mechanism to require initialization of members, and “raw” string literals to avoid escaping, just to name a few. Finally we'll peek a little further into the future at some features we’re working on that will take longer to get right.

With so much discussion around languages such as F#, Haskell and Erlang, it can seem as though getting started with Functional programming would mean first learning a whole new syntax...but what if it didn't?

Most .NET developers are familiar with the use of Linq, and basic constructs such as IEnumerable, Func delegates, arrow functions and ternary expressions, but did you know that you can use all of this to implement some of the most powerful patterns and techniques from the world of functional programming?

This talk will demonstrate how, using only familiar features available in out-of-the-box C#, to write Functional code that is:

* More robust
* Easier to read
* Easier to maintain

As well as these benefits, Functional code is a great enabler for the use of concurrency with Async functions and Serverless applications with technologies such as Azure Functions.

This talk might be of interest to anyone looking into moving to a new platform, or in improving the scalability of an existing application, or even just interested in seeing what Functional Programming is all about, but all within the comfort of a familiar language.

We might even attempt the impossible, and explain what a Monad is!

#Blazor is a free and open-source web framework that enables developers to create web apps using C# and HTML. We are using #DotNet5 and #DotNet6 as target framework in this video tutorial series. - Asp.Net Core

Blazor lets you build interactive web UIs using C# instead of JavaScript. Blazor apps are composed of reusable web UI components implemented using C#, HTML, and CSS. Both client and server code is written in C#, allowing you to share code and libraries.

Blazor can run your client-side C# code directly in the browser, using Blazor WebAssembly. Because it's real .NET running on #WebAssembly, you can re-use code and libraries from server-side parts of your application.

Alternatively, Blazor can run your client logic on the server (Blazor Server). Client UI events are sent back to the server using SignalR - a real-time messaging framework. Once execution completes, the required UI changes are sent to the client and merged into the DOM.

Blazor is not like Silverlight, Microsoft’s previous attempt at hosting in-browser applications. Silverlight required a browser plugin in order to run on the client, which prevented it from running on iOS devices.

Blazor does not require any kind of plugin installed on the client in order to execute inside a browser. Blazor either runs server-side, in which case it executes on a server and the browser acts like a dumb terminal, or it runs in the browser itself by utilising WebAssembly.

Because WebAssembly is a web standard, it is supported on all major browsers, which means also client-side Blazor apps will run inside a browser on Windows/Linux/Mac/Android and iOS.

What is C# programming language?
C# (C Sharp) is a multi-paradigm, general-purpose programming language. C# programming language encompasses the programming disciplines of static typing, strong typing, lexically scoped, imperative, declarative, functional, generic, object-oriented (class-based), and component-oriented.

What is C# application?
C# is a popular programming language for creating desktop applications, web applications, and web services. It is widely used in the development of Microsoft applications on a large scale. C# is also used in Unity game development.
Net framework is a ground-breaking platform that allows you to create the following types of applications:
Applications for Windows
Web-based applications
Web-based services
Net framework applications are cross-platform in nature. 

✅What is C# Programming? 
C# is a modern, object-oriented, general-purpose programming language that is pronounced ""C sharp."" It was created inside the.Net project by Microsoft, led by Anders Hejlsberg and his team, and was authorised by the European Computer Manufacturers Association (ECMA) and the International Standards Organization (ISO). C# is one of the languages supported by the Common Language Infrastructure, and the current version is 7.2. C# is syntactically similar to Java and is simple for users who are familiar with C, C++, or Java.

✅C# Career Prospects:
With just C# programming expertise, you will have excellent job opportunities, salaries, and career prospects. However, for a career based on programming languages such as Java and Python (which are in more demand than C#) or for careers based on front-end, back-end, and full-stack development, you will go a lot further with C# expertise. Furthermore, in development domains such as software testing, you are expected to know C#. C# gives us more Edge over other languages because of its .Net Framework integration.

With so much discussion around languages such as F#, Haskell and Erlang, it can seem as though getting started with Functional programming would mean first learning a whole new syntax...but what if it didn't?

Most .NET developers are familiar with the use of Linq, and basic constructs such as IEnumerable, Func delegates, arrow functions and ternary expressions, but did you know that you can use all of this to implement some of the most powerful patterns and techniques from the world of functional programming?

This talk will demonstrate how, using only familiar features available in out-of-the-box C#, to write Functional code that is:

* More robust
* Easier to read
* Easier to maintain

As well as these benefits, Functional code is a great enabler for the use of concurrency with Async functions and Serverless applications with technologies such as Azure Functions.

This talk might be of interest to anyone looking into moving to a new platform, or in improving the scalability of an existing application, or even just interested in seeing what Functional Programming is all about, but all within the comfort of a familiar language.

We might even attempt the impossible, and explain what a Monad is!",PT1H3M21S,C#

JWT (JSON Web Token) is a very common format of token-based implementation. It is so popular right now that it has become a de-facto standard for token-based authentication.
JWT token has 3 parts.
Header - Header gives the information about the algorithm used
Payload - this will have claims information
Signature - A hash to validate ASP.net Core JWT token.
-------------------------------
To implement it programmatically, we have to create a Token provider in our asp.net core web api project and use a private key to generate the token.  User provides the credentials and the token manager validates them and provides a JWT token if the user name and password are correct. In subsequent requests, client sends the JWT token back to the asp.net core web api application and based on the provided token, asp.net core application validates and returns the response if the token is valid.

We can give different parameters to asp.net core web api JWT token validation parameters. 

SaveToken - If it is set to true saves the token Authentication properties and we can retrieve it using HttpContent.

ValidateIssuer - Multiple asp.net core web api applications can generate same JWT tokens, so If it is set to true and add the Issuer details, asp.net core web api uses these details to validate the token.
